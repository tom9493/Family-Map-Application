# Family Map Project
This is a full stack implementation of a dummy family map application. 

The front end calls the backend through async methods and api calls to an HttpServer using JSON format. A DAO layer connects to a database made through SQL. The backend registers and logs in users. On registration, the backend generates coherent dummy data for each user that simulates generations in a family tree. This includes names, ages that make sense for the generations, and events such as birth, death (where appropriate), and other life events. The front end shows a Google Map with tags that show locations and information regarding the dummy family events for each generated family member. These tags are then linked together to show relations between family members and events. There are also settings that turn on and off particular lines drawn on the map. The front end is extensive, allowing you to scroll through the list of family members and see their information individually. 

This was my first large application and introduction to java. Android studio was also used to create and design the front end.

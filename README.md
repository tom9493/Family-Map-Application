# FamilyMapProject
This is a full stack implementation of a dummy family map application. The front end calls the backend through async methods and api calls. The backend generates coherent dummy data for each user that simulates generations in a family tree. The app shows a google map with tags that show locations and information regarding the dummy family events for each family member.
